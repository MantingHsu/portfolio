    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
    I'm an interior designer with a passion for transforming spaces into thoughtful, functional, and inspiring environments. With experience at <strong><a href="https://www.di-group.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DI Group</a></strong>, a boutique firm specializing in high-end residential and commercial interiors, I’ve worked across the full project lifecycle—from concept development and client presentations to 3D modeling, procurement, and on-site coordination.
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently pursuing a Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) and holding an MBA with a second major in Digital/Multimedia and Information Resources Design, I bring a business-oriented mindset to creative work. I’m especially drawn to roles that sit at the intersection of design and strategy—whether in interior architecture, design operations, branding, or digital experience. I’m seeking opportunities where I can contribute holistically: designing beautiful, human-centered spaces while optimizing workflows, communication, and impact behind the scenes.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the heart of my practice is a belief that good design tells a story—it reflects the people who live or work in a space, the culture that surrounds it, and the vision that drives it. I’m motivated by challenges that require both imagination and structure, and I’m excited to join a forward-thinking team where creativity, empathy, and leadership go hand-in-hand.
